## Reddit Search Board

This application is a reddit search form. The user will enter the page and be able to search for the title of a VALID subreddit and be provided with a number of articles (defined by the user) from that subreddit. The user can ask for 0-100 titles. If the user does not enter a valid subreddit title, the site will respond with an ERROR stating that the board does not exist and the form fields will turn red.

In order to run this application, first you must ```npm i``` in your terminal to download all the application's dependencies. This application uses babel-core, babel-loader, babel-preset-env, babel-preset-react, css-loader, eslint, extract-text-webpack-plugin, html-webpack-plugin, node-sass, react, react-dom, sass-loader, style-loader, superagent, webpack, and webpack-dev-server.

Once the application is running in your terminal, you can either run ```npm run build``` or ```npm run watch``` from your terminal. ```npm run build``` will construct the files required for the site and save them to your file system, whereas ```npm run watch``` will allow you to run the site without downloading any files to your computer.
